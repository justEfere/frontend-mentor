## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Media Querry
- Desktop-first workflow
- [Styled Components](<link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css2?family=Fraunces:wght@700&family=Montserrat:wght@500;700&display=swap") - For font family



### What I learned

I learned how to properly use the CSS media querry for responsive design. I wanted to use image tag srset which I looked up for alternative on how to switch the image for different mobile or desktop... I quickly found out it was an overkill and opted for background-image property instead, switching image on response to screen size.


### Continued development

I'm not yet confortable with responsiveness which I have to work on from now on. 


### Useful resources

- [Responsive image srcset](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/HTML/Multimedia_and_embedding/Responsive_images) - This helped me gain more insight on how to use img srcset. I really liked this pattern and will use it going forward.
- [CSS Media Query](https://www.w3schools.com/cssref/css3_pr_mediaquery.php) - This page have immersely assisted me with both documentation and preview examples. I'd recommend it to anyone still learning this concept.
