## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

Learned how to use the drag and drop web api. Although the drag and drop does not work on mobile because the api doesn't support touch.

### Continued development

I found out some things that are important to consider when building a todo app. This i will definately work on when developing a todo app again. this include; adding a position data to each to do because its seems to be in any position when loaded or reloaded.
