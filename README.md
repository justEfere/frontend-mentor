# Frontend Mentor Challenge solutions

These are my solutions or build for the [Frontend Mentor](https://www.frontendmentor.io) challenges. This list only contains challenges mainly based on HTML and CSS. That is because I have not fully grasped JS yet.
Google font family is mostly used and my most prefered icon pack is fontawesome.

This challenges has help me become consistent and helped me to code on a daily basis which I don't do before now.

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow



### What I learned

I learned a lot while taking these challeges and got better understanding of css properties and best places to apply each properties. I learned about the best practices to use as well as accessibily information. Properly develop a way to make responsive web design and how to start with mobile first approach.



### Continued development

I'm learning about Advanced web development to expand on animations, grid, gradients and other css pseudo properties with the hope of becomming better.
